# Best Model Serving Frameworks for SAE Interpretability Research

**The interpretability research community has largely developed specialized tooling rather than adapting production serving frameworks.** For your dictionary learning research with Sparse Autoencoders, you'll likely need a **hybrid approach**: serving frameworks for large-scale inference combined with research-specific tools for activation extraction and analysis.

## Executive Summary

For processing 10,000+ prompts in SAE research, **SGLang emerges as the optimal serving framework** with up to 3.1x higher throughput than alternatives, followed by **vLLM** as an excellent alternative. However, for the interpretability-specific requirements (activation extraction, causal interventions), you'll need **TransformerLens + SAELens** or **nnsight** as your primary research tools, potentially using serving frameworks only for the initial large-scale inference collection.

## The Research vs Production Divide

### Production Serving Frameworks:
- **Optimized for**: Throughput, latency, memory efficiency
- **Design priority**: Hide internal complexity for clean serving APIs
- **Use case**: Generating text outputs at scale

### Research Requirements for SAE Work:
- **Need access to**: Intermediate activations, layer representations, attention patterns  
- **Require ability to**: Patch activations, run causal interventions, extract embeddings
- **Workflow**: Deep introspection into model internals during inference

## Specific Recommendations for Your SAE Research

### For Dictionary Learning on Repetitive Tasks:

#### **Recommended Architecture:**
```
SGLang (serving) → TransformerLens/nnsight (analysis)
```

1. **Use SGLang** for large-scale batch inference to collect responses from 10k+ prompts
2. **Process responses** through TransformerLens or nnsight for activation extraction and SAE analysis  
3. **Run causal interventions** using research tools on smaller, targeted samples

#### **Alternative Architecture:**
```
vLLM (serving) → Custom PyTorch + SAELens (analysis)  
```

### Implementation Strategy:

**Phase 1: Data Collection**
- **SGLang or vLLM** for processing your repetitive task datasets efficiently
- **Focus on throughput** optimization for the 10k+ prompt processing
- **Collect raw model outputs** and save intermediate states if possible

**Phase 2: Interpretability Analysis**  
- **TransformerLens + SAELens** for extracting activations from multiple layers
- **Run SAE training** on collected activations
- **Perform causal interventions** on representative samples

**Phase 3: Validation Experiments**
- **Use research tools** for controlled experiments
- **Validate dictionary learning** results with causal interventions
- **Scale insights** back to larger datasets using serving frameworks

## Hardware and Cost Recommendations

### For Research Budgets:

**Optimal Setup**: **SGLang + H100 cloud instances**
- **Cost**: $2-5 per million tokens
- **Performance**: Superior batch processing
- **Flexibility**: Python codebase enables modifications

**Budget Alternative**: **vLLM + A100 instances**  
- **Cost**: $1-3 per million tokens
- **Reliability**: Mature framework with excellent community support
- **Integration**: Strong research ecosystem integration

**For Initial Exploration**: **Ollama + local RTX 4090**
- **Cost**: $0.50-1.50 per million tokens
- **Use case**: Small-scale experimentation and proof-of-concept

### Memory Requirements:
- **7B models**: 6-16GB VRAM (depending on quantization)
- **70B models**: 40-80GB VRAM (multi-GPU required)
- **Consider FP8 quantization** for 2x memory reduction with minimal quality loss

## Critical Implementation Advice

### What NOT to do:
- **Don't try to modify TensorRT-LLM** for activation extraction (extremely difficult)
- **Don't rely on Ollama** for large-scale experiments (performance limitations)
- **Don't expect production frameworks** to have built-in SAE research features

### Recommended Workflow:
1. **Start with TransformerLens** for small-scale SAE development and validation
2. **Scale to SGLang** for large batch processing once methods are proven
3. **Use hybrid approach**: Serving frameworks for inference, research tools for analysis
4. **Consider nnsight** if you need to work with very large models (70B+)

## Long-term Considerations

The interpretability research community is actively developing tools specifically for your use case. **TransformerLens and SAELens** represent years of specialized development that production serving frameworks cannot match. Your research will be more productive focusing on these purpose-built tools rather than trying to adapt production frameworks.

**For reliability in long-running experiments**, SGLang and vLLM have proven track records, while research tools like TransformerLens are designed for the iterative, exploratory nature of interpretability research.

The hybrid approach—using serving frameworks for scale and research frameworks for analysis—will give you the best of both worlds: the throughput needed for large-scale data collection and the interpretability features essential for SAE research.
